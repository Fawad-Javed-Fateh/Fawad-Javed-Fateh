### Projects
#### 1.) [MORDICAI](#):
Developed in *C-language*, me and my group made a complete university management system in lieu of that of our university. The concepts of Programming fundamentals were used to make the backend which was divided into two sections, Teacher's side (to manage attendence and upload grades .etc ) and the students side (to view attendence and grades .etc). For the front end we used the functions of *WINDOWS API* library to impelement an eye candy gui on *windows console*.
#### 2.) [SEYMOUR](https://github.com/Fawad-Javed-Fateh/Seymour):
We developed this project in *C++*. Using the principles and knowledges of oop, we made a dekstop application using *winforms* to emulate a fully functional pizzeria along with a robust and fully customizeable menu down to each individual component.
#### 3.) [ASHANTI](https://github.com/Fawad-Javed-Fateh/Ashanti): 
With the theme being *Natural Language Processing (NLP)*, we developed a hyvbrid search utility application whose objective was to search the inputed words from a large corpus of text (poems in our case) and return the results in *less than O(n) time*.
We used advanced data structures and some NLP technicques such as a *Stop Word* filter in order to compress and store our data set into a *hashtable* and reduce the searching time to be nearly constant in a corpus of more than 55k words. We also used ascii art to generate runtime *graphs* which provided the analysis of the frequencies of words in the documents as well as ranked the documents acc to their freuqencies.
#### 4.) [Niedrige Erwartungen](https://github.com/Fawad-Javed-Fateh/-Niedrige-Erwartungen):
We used *x86-Assembly Language* in order to develop a visaully pleasing shopping utility application and implemented mouse and sound support for enhanced user interaction. We further manupilated the runtime *heap* in order to dynamically allocate data for our runtime database of employees.
